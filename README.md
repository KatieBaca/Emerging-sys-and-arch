What did you do particularly well?

I was able to complete the build with few issues.

Where could you improve?

I need to spend more time writing code and exploring documentation.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

draw.io was an amazing tool to learn about. I have had to sign up for free trials to access similar software in the past, so I really appreciated how easy it was to get started.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I hope to use my RasperrbyPi again soon on other projects as well as to continue learning about and using circuit boards and microcontrollers. The hands-on elements in this class were really fun.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by following industry best practices.
